            <h1>family Background</h1>
            <h4>I come from a close-knit family of five. My mother, Kalpana Salunke, is a homemaker, and my father, Vijay Salunke, is a primary school teacher.
                I have a younger sister and a younger brother. My sister,Sakshi Salunke is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Arts , while 
                my brother, Kunal Salunkeis enrolled in a diploma program in AI and ML. 
                As the eldest child, I've always taken on additional responsibilities to support my family and siblings.Our family values education, hard work, and community service. 
                We often volunteer together at local charities and participate in community events. 
                A significant experience for our family was moving to a new city when I was young. 
                This experience helped us to adapt to change and appreciate different culture.
                I am excited to continue building on the strong foundation that my family has provided.</h4>
